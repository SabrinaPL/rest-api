## Description

This RESTful Movies API provides access to a movie database, allowing users to retrieve and manage movie, actor, and ratings information. The main features include:

    Movies Management: Fetch all movies, retrieve a specific movie by ID, and delete movies by ID (with JWT authentication).

    Actors and Credits: Get a list of all actors, fetch actors associated with a specific movie, and manage actor-related information.

    HATEOAS Links: Each response includes relevant navigation links for related resources, like movies, ratings, and credits.

    JWT Authentication & User Management: Register and delete users, with JWT authentication for secure actions like deleting user and movies.

The API supports pagination and structured data, ensuring easy integration with movie-related applications.
